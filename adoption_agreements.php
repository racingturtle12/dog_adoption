<h2> Adoption Agreements </h2>
<h4>Dog Haven agreements are the following:</h4>
<br>
<p>
    10-day grace period policy: If within the first 10 days of adoption you determine your adopted pet isnt a good fit or you find yourself unable to provide necessary medical care, 
    you may return your animal to Dog Haven and receive a 100% refund of your pets adoption fee. Please understand that if you choose to return the animal you will not be able to re-adopt the animal at any time.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
 Post 10-day return policy: If you decide to return your adopted pet to Dog Haven after the 10-day grace period, Dog Haven will make every effort to find a suitable foster home for the animal as quickly as possible. 
 Adopters are welcome to place their animal with friends and family  returning to Dog Haven is not a requirement but we do require notification of change of ownership. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Since Dog Haven is a foster-based organization with limited foster homes, we request at least 14 days to secure suitable placement in a foster home. We may ask that owners provide boarding for their animal in the interim, if necessary.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
 If an animal has posed a threat (i.e. bite history) Dog Haven may request the animal to be assessed by a professional trainer to ensure the animal is safe to place in a new home.
 Dog Haven may also offer to provide support services (such as offering a professional trainer, behaviorist assessment, or a discounted class at a local training facility) to owners willing and able to work with through their animals behavior issues.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Once an animal is returned, Dog Haven becomes the legal guardian and is solely responsible for using our judgment and discretion in placing an animal, including euthanasia decisions.
